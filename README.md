### Why Extract Markdown from PDFs for Notion?

While Notion allows you to preview PDFs stored in Google Drive through its connected app feature, saving the actual text content (as markdown) directly into Notion can offer several advantages:

- All-in-One Workspace: Users who prefer to keep everything inside Notion‚Äîwithout relying on external storage or integrations‚Äîcan have easy access to the paper's content.
- Privacy & Simplicity: No need to connect your Google Drive account if you just want the paper's text in Notion.
- Potential for Enhanced Notion AI: Extracted markdown content may allow Notion AI features such as summarization and improved search, which might not be fully available for embedded PDF files.
- Better Organization: Text content is searchable, editable, and can be structured alongside your notes, citations, and other research materials.

This tool makes it simple to keep full, formatted paper content inside Notion, maximizing both convenience and the power of Notion's workspace.

## üìã Notion Database Setup

### Required Properties

Your Notion database must have these properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Title** | Title | Paper title |
| **PubType** | Select | Publication type (Journal, Conference, etc.) |
| **Year** | Number | Publication year |
| **Venue** | Text | Journal/conference name |
| **DOI** | URL | Digital Object Identifier |
| **URL** | URL | Paper URL |
| **Abstract** | Text | Paper abstract |

### Optional Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **PDF (Drive)** | URL | Google Drive PDF links |
| **Drive File ID** | Text | Internal file tracking |
| **Authors** | Relation | Links to Authors database |

### Creating the Database

1. Create a new Notion database
2. Add the required properties above
3. Create a Notion integration at [notion.so/my-integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations)
4. Share your database with the integration
5. Copy the database ID from the URL

## üîó Paperpile Setup

To sync your papers from Paperpile, you'll need to get your personal BibTeX export URL:

### Step 1: Access Paperpile Integrations

1. **Open Paperpile** in your web browser
2. **Navigate to any paper** in your library
3. **Click on the "Integrations" tab** in the paper's side panel (usually located on the right side when viewing a paper)

### Step 2: Get Your BibTeX Export URL

1. In the **Integrations tab**, look for the **"Export"** or **"BibTeX"** section
2. You should see an option like **"Export all papers as BibTeX"** or similar
3. **Copy the provided URL** - this is your personal export link that will always contain your latest papers

The URL will look something like:
```
https://paperpile.com/eb/abcd1234efgh5678
```

### Step 3: Add to Environment File

1. Add the copied URL to your `.env` file:
   ```properties
   PAPERPILE_EXPORT_URL=https://paperpile.com/eb/your-actual-export-url
   ```

### Notes:
- This URL is **personal and private** - don't share it publicly
- The URL automatically updates when you add or modify papers in Paperpile
- You only need to set this up once

## üìÅ Google Drive Setup (Optional)

For automatic PDF linking:

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable the Google Drive API
3. Create a service account
4. Download the service account JSON key
5. Share your PDF folder with the service account email
6. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in your `.env` file

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Sync
```bash
python main.py
```

### Test Mode (No Notion Updates)
```bash
TEST_MODE=true python main.py
```

### Limited Processing (for testing)
```bash
LIMIT_MODE=true LIMIT_COUNT=5 python main.py
```

### Process with PDF Content Extraction
```bash
PDF_MAX_PAGES=10 python main.py
```

## üïí Automated Scheduling

For regular synchronization, you can set up cyclical updates using your system's scheduling tools.

### For macOS:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Edit the crontab file:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
3. Add the following entry to run a script every hour (adjust timing as needed):
   ```bash
   0 * * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```
4. Save and exit the editor.

### For Windows:

1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Create a new basic task and give it a name.
3. Set the trigger (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.).
4. Set the action to run a program or script.
5. Browse to the script or program you want to run and finish the setup.

### For GitHub Actions (Recommended):

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the sync on a daily schedule. This is the easiest way to set up automated synchronization without managing your own server infrastructure.

#### How it works:
- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 02:00 UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab
- **Environment**: Uses Python 3.11 with all required dependencies
- **Security**: Credentials are stored as GitHub repository secrets

#### Setup:
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to your forked repository's **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `PAPERPILE_EXPORT_URL`: Your Paperpile BibTeX export URL
   - `NOTION_TOKEN`: Your Notion integration token  
   - `NOTION_DB_ID`: Your Notion database ID
   - `AUTHORS_DB_ID` (optional): Your authors database ID
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (optional): Your Google service account JSON as a string

#### The workflow file:
```yaml
name: Sync Paperpile to Notion

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 02:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - run: python main.py
      env:
        PAPERPILE_EXPORT_URL: ${{ secrets.PAPERPILE_EXPORT_URL }}
        NOTION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}
        NOTION_DB_ID: ${{ secrets.NOTION_DB_ID }}
        # ... other secrets
```

üìÅ **Workflow location**: [`.github/workflows/sync-paperpile-notion.yml`](.github/workflows/sync-paperpile-notion.yml)

#### Monitoring:
- View sync logs in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository
- Receive email notifications for failed runs (configurable in GitHub settings)
- Manual runs can be triggered anytime from the Actions tab
